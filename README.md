In a competitive job market, our team's research focuses on factors affecting employability. We've analyzed a dataset of over 70,000 job applicants, sourced from Stack Overflow and Kaggle, to explore the impact of education, age, mental health, and gender on employment. Key findings include:
* the influence of education on computer skills
* age as a factor in professional development, and
* higher salaries for individuals with mental health issues.

We have conducted various hypothesis tests, such as Chi-square, ANOVA, and t-tests, to support our conclusions.

While the dataset has some limitations, including a male-heavy bias, it offers valuable insights for employers and job seekers. There's also possibility for further research, including model building to predict job prospects. This research aims to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity in the ever-evolving job market.
